- Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration  
- Data manipulation with Pandas  
- Reproducible workflows and coding best practices  
- Introduction to machine learning with Scikit-learn  
- Review of linear algebra, probability, and statistics for data science  
- Neural networks, dimensionality reduction, and network analysis  
- Team projects with real-world applications (often via BU Spark!)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:  
1. Use Git and GitHub for collaborative, reproducible coding.  
2. Build and document data workflows in Jupyter.  
3. Apply Pandas and Python libraries to wrangle and analyze data.  
4. Implement basic machine learning models with Scikit-learn.  
5. Work effectively in teams to deliver real-world data projects.

## Course Highlights
- **Midterm Kaggle Competition**: Apply machine learning methods in a competitive, hands-on format.  
- **Final Project**: Team-based, real-world data project (often with external clients via BU Spark!).  
- **Interactive Notes**: Course materials provided in Quarto with executable Python code.

## Tools and Technologies
The course incorporates modern tools to facilitate data science practice:  
- **Programming**: Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Collaboration**: Git, GitHub  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Platforms**: Piazza, Gradescope, Kaggle  

---

## Course Policies
- **Participation**: Active engagement in discussions and labs is required.  
- **Homework**: No late submissions accepted, except one assignment may be submitted up to 3 days late (with prior notice to TAs).  
- **Academic Integrity**: Collaboration in discussions is encouraged, but all homework must be authored individually.  
- **AI Assistance**: Generative AI tools may be used only with proper citation (including tool name, prompts, and outputs).
